## About

I built this tiny site as a joke in reference to a tweet by Jeff Atwood:
https://twitter.com/codinghorror/status/1276934067015974912

Here's my finished image:

![Exit Vim Image](src/images/exitvim.jpg)

The picture is in reference to the movie Arrival.

This site was built on top of the gatsby starter for tailwind, found here:
https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/taylorbryant/gatsby-starter-tailwind/

I added gatsby-plugin-twitter:
https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-twitter/

To be able to embed his tweet on the `About` page.


If you want to run it locally, you can just run `gatsby develop`
